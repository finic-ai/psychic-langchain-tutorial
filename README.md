# Psychic LangChain tutorial

This is the code for the [How to use LangChain and Psychic to answer questions about your documents with AI]() tutorial. There are two ways to run this app.

## API Server
`server.py` contains the code for setting up a HTTP server that can respond to queries about content connected through the Psychic Notion connector.

## Python notebook
`psychic_notebook.ipynb` is a Python notebook with a demo of the same functionality, minus the API server. This is an easier way to play around with the functionality without cloning this repo. Run it with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or just copy the hosted version [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gShmRMig-nBQYn5GBAyRDNlw8dgWbbw2?usp=sharing)
